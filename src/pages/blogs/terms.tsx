        <li>In connection with a business transaction, such as a merger or sale of assets.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable measures to protect the security and integrity of your personal information. However, no security system is completely infallible, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Users are advised to take their own security measures, including regularly updating passwords and monitoring account activity. All security implementations are displayed open-source within the <code>polybrain-server</code> repository. </p>
